This project focuses on designing and developing a visually appealing, fully responsive single-page website for a fictional restaurant named The Golden Spoon. The landing page is crafted to provide visitors with an engaging digital experience that reflects the restaurant’s warm and inviting ambiance. Key sections include a bold header with navigation, an immersive hero image with a welcome message, a structured menu showcasing starters, mains, and desserts, an “About Us” segment with a short story and imagery, and a contact section featuring address, phone, hours, and social links.
